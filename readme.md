This repository contains code for fetching some information about a GitHub user. Below information on both of my accounts(kweeuhree and firstnamenika) can be found. All information is being populated dynamically using GitHub API.<br>
getter.mjs uses Fetch and works well, poster.mjs uses axios and does not work, because it needs a personal access token.
