This repository contains a code for fetching some information about a github user. Below information on both of my accounts(kweeuhree and firstnamenika) can be found. All information is being populated dynamically using Github API.
getter.mjs uses Fetch and works well, poster.mjs uses axios and does not work, because it needs a personal access token.
